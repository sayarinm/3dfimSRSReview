Software Requirements Specification for 3dfim+
Nejad & Smith 2017

Brief review and comments by Dean Inglis 

pg. 13 spelling "literarure" 
pg. 14 grammatic "...systems related to the medical imaging."
  should read "...systems related to medical imaging." etc.
  and further " ...work with the medical images." 
  should read "...work with medical images."
pg. 25 use of 'd' instead of 'n' ?
pg. 30 voxel definition: slice consists of m x n not n x n voxels ?

There is no overview of what the MRI signal is at each voxel for fMRI.
There is no discussion as to the usefulness of the computed results (eg.,
deviation from baseline signal indicates localized brain activity ? etc.).
Perhaps it is not the goal of software specification, but to the reader
a contextual discussion might be of interest.  Otherwise, a very
competent, logically organized and thorough specification.
